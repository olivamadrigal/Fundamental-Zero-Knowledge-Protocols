# Fundamental-Zero-Knowledge-Protocols

Simulation of fundamental interactive, non-interactive, and succinct ZKPs from Massimo Bertaccini's Cryptography Algorithms book released March 2022 which covers blockchain algorithms, quantum cryptography, zk protocols, and homomorphic encryption.

Concept: proving knowlegde of a statement and corresponding example attacks.

Uses OpenSSL API with so you can play with different numbers besides the numerical examples provided in the book.

1. NIZK: Non-Interactive ZKP using RSA as example

2. Schnorr Interactive ZKP

3. zk-SNARK based on discrete log problem
